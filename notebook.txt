    A movie has a title (e.g. "Wonder Woman 1984"), an overview ("Wonder Woman comes into conflict with the Soviet Union during the Cold War in the 1980s!"), a poster url and a rating (6.9).

  rails generate model movie title:string overview:text poster_url:string rating:float

    A list has a name (e.g. "Drama", "Comedy", "Classic", "To rewatch", … )
    rails generate model list name:string



    A bookmark adds a movie to a list (e.g. Wonder Woman has been added to the “Girl Power” watch list). So each bookmark references a movie and a list, with a comment. The comment field is for the user to add a little note on the bookmark (e.g. Alan Turing recommended this movie).
